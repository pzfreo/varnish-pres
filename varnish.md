# Why Colophony Varnish?
![bg](pictures/colophony.webp)

* Colophony is a resin - the result of drying pine sap
* Before Colophony, simply drying oils
* Historically never formed a very hard surface 
* For Strad and Amati, colophony varnish was available and cheaper than other resins 
* Used extensively until the late 1700s

# Why do we use Colophony?

* It is hard to get right 
  * (That is why they gave up)
* Difficult and hazardous to process 

... *but*

* Historically Authentic
  * Great for antiquing
* Beautiful when done right

# The basic process

* Cook a drying oil (e.g linseed) for a few hours 
* Cook colophony resin for some amount of time (will be explained later)
* Mix the two together in a specific proportion with heat to create a varnish
* Potentially use a solvent to thin the varnish

---

![bg opacity](pictures/bubbles.png)
# Optional extras

* **Bubble air** through the oil while cooking or instead of cooking
* Add **metal salts** to the oil (dryers)
* Cook colophony with a **lid** on
* Add metal salts to the colophony (to create *rosinates*)
* Add colour compounds and metal salts to the **oil** *or* **colophony** *or* **varnish**

# Why do we cook oil?

* We need the oil to polymerise (aka drying)
* Start the polymerisation 
* Too much cooking and we have sludge = fully polymerised

# Resin should **not** dissolve in oil
* When the colophony dissolves the varnish never dries!
* Varnish is a *colloidal* mixture with microscopic droplets of resin mixed into the oil

# The Balancing Act: Common Failures and Their Causes

<div class="columns">
<div class="column">

## FAILURE OF COMPATIBILITY
### (Too Soluble)

**Cause:** The resin is *too* compatible with the oil. The droplets are so small that the resin molecules completely envelop the oil molecules.

**Mechanism:** This "armor" prevents oxygen from reaching the oil, blocking polymerization.

The varnish **stays sticky forever.**

</div>
<div class="column">

## FAILURE OF HOMOGENEITY
### (Too Insoluble)

**Cause:** The resin is not compatible enough. The large droplets separate from the oil after application.

**Mechanism:** The more resinous part migrates to the surface, forming a skin that traps uncured oil and solvents underneath.

The surface feels dry, but the film **remains soft and marks easily.**

</div>
</div>

---

# 1. The Physics of Oil Varnish
*   **Not a Real Dissolution:** Varnish is a **colloidal suspension** (emulsion), not a true solution like salt in water.
*   **The Structure:** Resin forms microscopic **droplets** inside the oil.
*   **Dimension Matters:** The size of these droplets determines if the varnish dries or remains a "gummy" mess.

    E -->|Optimal| G[Homogeneous: Dries Well]
    E -->|Too Large| H[Incompatible: Surface Skinning]
</div>


---

# 3. The Polymerisation Puzzle
*   **The Process:** Oily varnishes dry through **chemical changes (polymerisation)** of fatty acids when exposed to oxygen.
*   **The Oxygen Block:** If the resin and oil are **too compatible**, the resin "recovers" the oil molecule, blocking the oxygen needed for drying.
*   **The "Filler" Effect:** Less compatible resins act as an **inert filler**, providing more surface contact and helping the oil dry faster.

---

# 4. Colophony: The "Weak" Resin
*   **Composition:** Primarily **abietic acid** (95%) from the *Pinaceae* family.
*   **The Problem:** Raw colophony is **too soluble** in oil.
*   **The Consequence:** It bonds too intimately, preventing the oil from polymerising, resulting in a film that stays **sticky forever**.
*   **The Goal:** Makers must **decrease solubility** (insolubilise) to make it functional.

---

# 5. Cooking Techniques and Oxidation
*   **Under 240°C:** Activates **oxidation**, making the resin darker and more insoluble.
*   **Above 240°C:** The resin begins to **decompose** (crack), creating "resin oils" that can cause permanent stickiness.
*   **Open vs. Closed Pan:** Cooking in an open pan allows acidic fumes to escape, while a lid keeps them inside, increasing acidity.

---

# 6. Chemical Modification: Lime
*   **Calcium Rosinate:** Adding **7% lime (calcium hydroxide)** chemically transforms the resin.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Makes resin harder and **less thermoplastic**.
    *   Significantly improves **drying reliability**.
    *   Acts as a "life server" by reacting with contaminants over time.

    E -->|Sticky Varnish| F[Use Petrol to reduce compatibility]
    E -->|Surface Skinning| G[Use Spike Oil to increase solubility]
</div>


---

# 8. Solvent Strategy for Homogeneity
*   **Turpentine:** The standard base solvent, relatively unpolar.
*   **Spike Lavender Oil:** A polar solvent that dissolves highly insoluble or overcooked resins to ensure **homogeneity**.
*   **Petrol (White Spirit/D70):** Used for **slow evaporation** (large instruments) and to encourage larger droplet formation in undercooked resins.
*   **Risk:** If the solvent does not dissolve the mixture well enough, the resin migrates to the surface, creating a **skin** that traps soft varnish inside.

---

# 9. Color Theory: Perception of Brown
*   **The Human Construct:** Brown does not exist as a physical frequency in nature; it is a mental interpretation of **orange in shadow**.
*   **Aesthetic Dynamic:** Created by the **contrast** between wide spectra and pure frequencies.
*   **Dynamic Aesthetic:** Violin varnish provides a **dynamic aesthetic** because it changes as the instrument moves.

---

# 10. The Secret to "Vibrant" Color
To achieve "vibration" or "electricity" in color, combine two types of spectra:
1.  **Wide Spectrum (The Body):** Provides fullness (e.g., a brown base or dark colophony).
2.  **Pure Frequency (The Peak):** Intense "electric" colors (e.g., Alizarin or Cochineal).
*   **Avoid Flatness:** Only a wide spectrum is boring; only a peak frequency looks "washed off".

---

# 11. Alizarin Fixation: The Double Table
*   **The Molecule:** Alizarin is a soluble dye that must be fixed with **metallic salts** for light stability.
*   **Metal Priority:** When multiple metals are present, one will dominate the final color.
*   **The Phase Problem:** Alizarin produces different colors depending on whether it binds to the **oil** or the **resin**.

---

# 12. Fixation Color Results
| Metal | Color on Oil | Color on Resin |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Aluminum (Al)** | Orange-Red | Pink |
| **Calcium (Ca)** | "Shitty" Brown | Beautiful Purple-Red |
| **Iron (Fe)** | Brown | Dark Purple |
| **Tin (Sn)** | Orange | Orange/Purple |

*   **Solvent Warning:** Strong solvents can cause Alizarin to "jump" from resin to oil, turning a purple varnish brown.

---

# 13. Historical Context: Cremona’s Evolution
*   **Early Era (Pre-1680):** Makers like Amati used very **light, clear colophony** bases.
*   **Transition (1680–1730):** Stradivari introduced an **orange-based system** combining dark colophony, iron oxides (hematite), and red lakes.
*   **Late Era (Post-1730):** Makers shifted almost entirely to **dark colophony bases**, likely because lighter bases were unreliable and prone to drying failure.

---

# 14. Historical Pigments: Iron Oxides
*   **Hematite:** The primary pigment used by Renaissance makers.
*   **Transparency Secret:** Because iron oxide has a poor refraction index, it must be **nanoparticle scale** to remain transparent.
*   **Optical Effect:** Nano-iron oxides polarise light, giving the instrument a "photographic" look that moves less than spirit varnishes.

---

# 15. Practical Workflow & Summary
*   **Test Small:** Always test color fixation on a small batch; the system is a complex "multi-parameter" mess.
*   **Monitoring:** Use **UV fluorescence** to judge the oxidation state of resin (target: yellow/orange).
*   **Resin Ratio:** Use **Long Oil** (>50% oil) for resistant new instruments; **Short Oil** (>60% resin) for chipping and antiquing effects.
*   **Analogy:** Think of varnish as **balloons (resin) floating in water (oil)**. If they are too small and tight, the "water" can't breathe or dry.
